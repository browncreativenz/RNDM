# RNDM // Artist-curated generative system

RNDM is an artist-curated generative system that continually outputs non-repeatable, ephemeral digital compositions.  
Created by the machine, directed by human aesthetic constraints.

---

## Concept
RNDM explores the intersection of human artistic direction and algorithmic randomness.  
The system selects from curated image and mask sets, applies random transformations, blend modes, and colors — producing pieces that will never repeat exactly.  
Each composition exists only briefly before fading into the next.

```
/assets
    /bg.gif             → Background texture
    /img1.jpg … img40   → Curated image library
/masks/mask1.svg … mask15.svg → Shape masks
index.html              → Main application
```
